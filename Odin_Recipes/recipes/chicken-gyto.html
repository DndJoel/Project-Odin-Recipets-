  <h2>
    <p>Chicken gyros is a popular Greek dish made with marinated chicken, typically cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The seasoned chicken is thinly sliced and served in a pita bread wrap. It is traditionally accompanied by fresh vegetables like tomatoes, onions, and lettuce, and topped with tzatziki sauceâ€”a creamy yogurt-based sauce with cucumber, garlic, and herbs. Gyros are often enjoyed as street food or a casual meal, known for their vibrant flavors and Mediterranean influence.</p>
