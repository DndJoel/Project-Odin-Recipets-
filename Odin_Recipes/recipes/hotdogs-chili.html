    <p> A hot dog is a type of cooked sausage, typically made from beef, pork, or a combination, and is served in a sliced bun. It is often garnished with condiments like mustard, ketchup, onions, relish, and sauerkraut. Hot dogs are a popular fast food in the U.S., especially at sporting events and barbecues.</p>

    <p>Chili, also known as chili con carne, is a spicy stew made with ground or cubed beef, chili peppers, tomatoes, beans (optional in some recipes), and a blend of spices like cumin, garlic, and oregano. It is commonly served on its own or used as a topping for foods like hot dogs, nachos, or baked potatoes. Chili is a hearty and flavorful dish associated with American Southwestern and Tex-Mex cuisine.</p>
